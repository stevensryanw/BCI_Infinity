#Script for the user training process
#First 5 min of recording data will be rest and labeled normal
#After that we will prompt the user random movements, with 30sec rest inbetween each movement
#Each movement that is selected will be done 50 times(40 train, 10 test) in a random order
#Plan to use 5 movements: left arm, right arm, blinks, legs, and tongue
